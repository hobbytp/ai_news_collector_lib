        I think the JJ VCS (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jj-vcs&#x2F;jj\"
        rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jj-vcs&#x2F;jj</a>) hit
        a point some time in this past year where I find it hard to find a great reason
        to continue using git. Over the years I&#x27;ve cobbled together aliases and
        bash functions to try to improve my git workflow, but after using jj, which
        works with ~any git repo and integrates great with Github repos, all of the
        workflow issues I ran into with git are not only solved, but improved in ways
        I couldn&#x27;t manage with simple scripts.<p>One example is the op log, which
        lets you go to any point in your repo&#x27;s time and provides simple undo
        and redo commands when you want to back out of a merge, didn&#x27;t mean to
        rebase, etc.<p>Because I have a pretty strong conviction that JJ is at this
        point a cleaner and more powerful version of git, my hopes are that it continues
        to grow. With that, it seemed a proper full-featured GUI was missing for the
        VCS. There&#x27;s some plugins that add some integration into VS Code, and
        there&#x27;s one in the works to get Intellij support working, but many of
        the constructs JJ provides in my opinion necessitate a grounds-up build of
        a GUI around how JJ works.<p>Right now, Judo for JJ is an MVP in an open beta.
        I did my best to support all of the core functionality one would need, though
        there&#x27;s many nice-to-haves that I am going to add, like native merge
        support, native splitting, etc. Most of this will be based on feedback from
        the Beta.<p>I&#x27;m really grateful for the great community JJ has built,
        alongside the HN community itself in the countless VCS-based posts I&#x27;ve
        read over the years, and am hoping for lots of input here during Beta under
        real usage - the goal is to be a full-featured desktop GUI for the VCS, similar
        to many of the great products that are out there for git.","time":1760974519,"title":"Show

        excited to share EloqDoc, a new open source document database built on top
        of Data Substrate. EloqDoc is designed around the principle of treating object
        storage (like S3) as a first-class citizen for durability and cost efficiency.
        If you love the flexibility of MongoDB&#x27;s document model but are struggling
        with scaling, cost, and consistency due to its coupled architecture, EloqDoc
        is for you. It\u2019s built to solve MongoDB&#x27;s inherent infrastructure
        challenges while remaining fully compatible with existing MongoDB clients
        and drivers.<p>Key Features:<p>1. Object Storage as First Citizen: Uses object
        storage for primary durability, leveraging local NVMe caching to achieve both
        lower cost and higher performance than using block-level storage (e.g. EBS).<p>2.
        Decoupled Compute &amp; Storage: Scale your compute&#x2F;QPS independently
        of your storage capacity, or vice-versa, without data movement.<p>3. True
        ACID Transactions: Delivers full ACID compliance with especially fast distributed
        transactions\u2014consistency without compromise.<p>4. Native Distribution
        &amp; Multi-Writer: It&#x27;s a natively distributed database, eliminating
        complex manual sharding routers (like mongos) and supporting true Multi-Writer
        scalability.<p>Check it out:\\n<a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.github.com&#x2F;eloqdata&#x2F;eloqdoc\\\"

        I think the JJ VCS (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jj-vcs&#x2F;jj\"
        rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jj-vcs&#x2F;jj</a>) hit
        a point some time in this past year where I find it hard to find a great reason
        to continue using git. Over the years I&#x27;ve cobbled together aliases and
        bash functions to try to improve my git workflow, but after using jj, which
        works with ~any git repo and integrates great with Github repos, all of the
        workflow issues I ran into with git are not only solved, but improved in ways
        I couldn&#x27;t manage with simple scripts.<p>One example is the op log, which
        lets you go to any point in your repo&#x27;s time and provides simple undo
        and redo commands when you want to back out of a merge, didn&#x27;t mean to
        rebase, etc.<p>Because I have a pretty strong conviction that JJ is at this
        point a cleaner and more powerful version of git, my hopes are that it continues
        to grow. With that, it seemed a proper full-featured GUI was missing for the
        VCS. There&#x27;s some plugins that add some integration into VS Code, and
        there&#x27;s one in the works to get Intellij support working, but many of
        the constructs JJ provides in my opinion necessitate a grounds-up build of
        a GUI around how JJ works.<p>Right now, Judo for JJ is an MVP in an open beta.
        I did my best to support all of the core functionality one would need, though
        there&#x27;s many nice-to-haves that I am going to add, like native merge
        support, native splitting, etc. Most of this will be based on feedback from
        the Beta.<p>I&#x27;m really grateful for the great community JJ has built,
        alongside the HN community itself in the countless VCS-based posts I&#x27;ve
        read over the years, and am hoping for lots of input here during Beta under
        real usage - the goal is to be a full-featured desktop GUI for the VCS, similar
        to many of the great products that are out there for git.","time":1760974519,"title":"Show

        got tired of playwright-mcp eating through Claude&#x27;s 200K token limit,
        so I built this using the new Claude Skills system. Built it with Claude Code
        itself.<p>Instead of sending accessibility tree snapshots on every action,
        Claude just writes Playwright code and runs it. You get back screenshots and
        console output. That&#x27;s it.<p>314 lines of instructions vs a persistent
        MCP server. Full API docs only load if Claude needs them.<p>Same browser automation,
        way less overhead. Works as a Claude Code plugin or manual install.<p>Token

        excited to share EloqDoc, a new open source document database built on top
        of Data Substrate. EloqDoc is designed around the principle of treating object
        storage (like S3) as a first-class citizen for durability and cost efficiency.
        If you love the flexibility of MongoDB&#x27;s document model but are struggling
        with scaling, cost, and consistency due to its coupled architecture, EloqDoc
        is for you. It\u2019s built to solve MongoDB&#x27;s inherent infrastructure
        challenges while remaining fully compatible with existing MongoDB clients
        and drivers.<p>Key Features:<p>1. Object Storage as First Citizen: Uses object
        storage for primary durability, leveraging local NVMe caching to achieve both
        lower cost and higher performance than using block-level storage (e.g. EBS).<p>2.
        Decoupled Compute &amp; Storage: Scale your compute&#x2F;QPS independently
        of your storage capacity, or vice-versa, without data movement.<p>3. True
        ACID Transactions: Delivers full ACID compliance with especially fast distributed
        transactions\u2014consistency without compromise.<p>4. Native Distribution
        &amp; Multi-Writer: It&#x27;s a natively distributed database, eliminating
        complex manual sharding routers (like mongos) and supporting true Multi-Writer
        scalability.<p>Check it out:\\n<a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.github.com&#x2F;eloqdata&#x2F;eloqdoc\\\"

        I think the JJ VCS (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jj-vcs&#x2F;jj\"
        rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jj-vcs&#x2F;jj</a>) hit
        a point some time in this past year where I find it hard to find a great reason
        to continue using git. Over the years I&#x27;ve cobbled together aliases and
        bash functions to try to improve my git workflow, but after using jj, which
        works with ~any git repo and integrates great with Github repos, all of the
        workflow issues I ran into with git are not only solved, but improved in ways
        I couldn&#x27;t manage with simple scripts.<p>One example is the op log, which
        lets you go to any point in your repo&#x27;s time and provides simple undo
        and redo commands when you want to back out of a merge, didn&#x27;t mean to
        rebase, etc.<p>Because I have a pretty strong conviction that JJ is at this
        point a cleaner and more powerful version of git, my hopes are that it continues
        to grow. With that, it seemed a proper full-featured GUI was missing for the
        VCS. There&#x27;s some plugins that add some integration into VS Code, and
        there&#x27;s one in the works to get Intellij support working, but many of
        the constructs JJ provides in my opinion necessitate a grounds-up build of
        a GUI around how JJ works.<p>Right now, Judo for JJ is an MVP in an open beta.
        I did my best to support all of the core functionality one would need, though
        there&#x27;s many nice-to-haves that I am going to add, like native merge
        support, native splitting, etc. Most of this will be based on feedback from
        the Beta.<p>I&#x27;m really grateful for the great community JJ has built,
        alongside the HN community itself in the countless VCS-based posts I&#x27;ve
        read over the years, and am hoping for lots of input here during Beta under
        real usage - the goal is to be a full-featured desktop GUI for the VCS, similar
        to many of the great products that are out there for git.","time":1760974519,"title":"Show

        excited to share EloqDoc, a new open source document database built on top
        of Data Substrate. EloqDoc is designed around the principle of treating object
        storage (like S3) as a first-class citizen for durability and cost efficiency.
        If you love the flexibility of MongoDB&#x27;s document model but are struggling
        with scaling, cost, and consistency due to its coupled architecture, EloqDoc
        is for you. It\u2019s built to solve MongoDB&#x27;s inherent infrastructure
        challenges while remaining fully compatible with existing MongoDB clients
        and drivers.<p>Key Features:<p>1. Object Storage as First Citizen: Uses object
        storage for primary durability, leveraging local NVMe caching to achieve both
        lower cost and higher performance than using block-level storage (e.g. EBS).<p>2.
        Decoupled Compute &amp; Storage: Scale your compute&#x2F;QPS independently
        of your storage capacity, or vice-versa, without data movement.<p>3. True
        ACID Transactions: Delivers full ACID compliance with especially fast distributed
        transactions\u2014consistency without compromise.<p>4. Native Distribution
        &amp; Multi-Writer: It&#x27;s a natively distributed database, eliminating
        complex manual sharding routers (like mongos) and supporting true Multi-Writer
        scalability.<p>Check it out:\\n<a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.github.com&#x2F;eloqdata&#x2F;eloqdoc\\\"

        HN, I just released this music theory and ear training mobile app for guitar
        which I&#x27;ve been working on for a bit more than a year on the side.<p>The
        idea was to make something for the eternally &quot;intermediate&quot; guitarist
        (myself included). There are a lot of beginner apps which rely on learning
        songs, toolkits which give you a bunch of stuff with no explanation but not
        many in-between apps to actually learn and practice more generic and somewhat
        advanced stuff.<p>The app contains short lessons, recaps and most importantly
        challenges (visual, audio and pure theory) along with a very complete library.<p>The
        challenges are made for practicing, they will get increasingly harder and
        getting to the max score is supposed to be quite hard. The idea being that
        you have to repeat them regularly until your brain has integrated the info
        and it flows naturally rather than being a one time quick dopamine shot. This
        is partly inspired by how language learning apps work.<p>It has no ads, a
        lifetime purchase option and you can use it without an account if you don&#x27;t

        Robin, Louis, and Thomas. Pipelex is a DSL and a Python runtime for repeatable
        AI workflows. Think Dockerfile&#x2F;SQL for multi-step LLM pipelines: you
        declare steps and interfaces; any model&#x2F;provider can fill them.<p>Why
        this instead of yet another workflow builder?<p>- Declarative, not glue code:
        you state what to do; the runtime figures out how.\\n- Agent-first: each step
        carries natural-language context (purpose, inputs&#x2F;outputs with meaning)
        so LLMs can follow, audit, and optimize. Our MCP server enables agents to
        run pipelines but also to build new pipelines on demand.\\n- Open standard
        under MIT: language spec, runtime, API server, editor extensions, MCP server,
        n8n node.\\n- Composable: pipes can call other pipes, created by you or shared
        in the community.<p>Why a domain-specific language?<p>- We need context, meaning
        and nuances preserved in a structured syntax that both humans and LLMs can
        understand\\n- We need determinism, control, and reproducibility that pure
        prompts can&#x27;t deliver\\n- Bonus: editors, diffs, semantic coloring, easy
        sharing, search &amp; replace, version control, linters\u2026<p>How we got
        there:<p>Initially, we just wanted to solve every use-case with LLMs but kept
        rebuilding the same agentic patterns across different projects. So we challenged
        ourselves to keep the code generic and separate from use-case specifics, which
        meant modeling workflows from the relevant knowledge and know-how.<p>Unlike
        existing code&#x2F;no-code frameworks for AI workflows, our abstraction layer
        doesn&#x27;t wrap APIs, it transcribes business logic into a structured, unambiguous
        script executable by software and AI. Hence the &quot;declarative&quot; aspect:
        the script says what should be done, not how to do it. It&#x27;s like a Dockerfile
        or SQL for AI workflows.<p>Additionally, we wanted the language to be LLM-friendly.
        Classic programming languages hide logic and context in variable names, functions,
        and comments: all invisible to the interpreter. In Pipelex, these elements
        are explicitly stated in natural language, giving AI full visibility: it&#x27;s
        all logic and context, with minimal syntax.<p>Then, we didn&#x27;t want to
        write Pipelex scripts ourselves so we dogfooded: we built a Pipelex workflow
        that writes Pipelex workflows. It&#x27;s in the MCP and CLI: &quot;pipelex
        build pipe &#x27;\u2026&#x27;&quot; runs a multi-step, structured generation
        flow that produces a validated workflow ready to execute with &quot;pipelex
        run&quot;. Then you can iterate on it yourself or with any coding agent.<p>What\u2019s
        included: Python library, FastAPI and Docker, MCP server, n8n node, VS Code
        extension.<p>What we\u2019d like from you<p>1. Build a workflow: did the language
        work for you or against you?\\n2. Agent&#x2F;MCP workflows and n8n node usability.\\n3.
        Suggest new kinds of pipes and other AI models we could integrate\\n4. Looking
        for OSS contributors to the core library but also to share pipes with the
        community<p>Known limitations<p>- Connectors: Pipelex doesn\u2019t integrate
        with \u201Cyour apps\u201D, we focus on the cognitive steps, and you can integrate
        through code&#x2F;API or using MCP or n8n\\n- Visualization: we need to generate
        flow-charts\\n- The pipe builder is still buggy\\n- Run it yourself: we don\u2019t
        yet provide a hosted Pipelex API, it\u2019s in the works\\n- Cost-tracking:
        we only track LLM costs, not image generation or OCR costs yet\\n- Caching
        and reasoning options: not supported yet<p>Links<p>- GitHub: <a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Pipelex&#x2F;pipelex\\\"

        Hacker News! I\u2019m a Bayesian statistician that has been working on applying
        hierarchical mixture models (originally developed for genomics) to structure
        text data, and in the process, used these models to build (what started as
        a personal) tool for conducting literature reviews and deep research.<p>My
        literature review process starts with a broad search to find a few key papers&#x2F;groups,
        and from there expands along their citation networks. I needed to conduct
        a few rounds of literature reviews during the course of my research and decided
        to build a tool to facilitate this process. The tool started as an experimental
        wrapper over low-level statistical software in C, quickly became a testing&#x2F;iteration
        ground for our api, and is now my personal go-to for lit reviews.<p>The tool
        organizes corpuses of text content, visualizes the high level themes, and
        enables me to pull up relevant excerpts. Unlike LLMs, this model transparently
        organizes the data and can train from scratch quickly on small datasets to
        learn custom hierarchical taxonomies. My favorite part of the tool is the
        citation network integration: any research paper it pulls up has a button
        \u201CCitation Network Deep Dive\u201D that pulls every paper that cites or
        is cited by the original paper, and organizes it for further exploration.<p>I
        initially built this tool for academic research, but ended up extending it
        to support Hacker News to mine technical conversation, the top 200 Google
        results, and earnings transcripts. We have a gallery of ready to explore results
        on the homepage. If you are kicking off a custom deep dive, it takes about
        1-5 minutes for academic search, 3-7 minutes for Hacker News, and 5-10 minutes
        for Google.\\nTo demonstrate the process, I put together a video walkthrough
        of a short literature review I conducted on AI hallucinations: <a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OUmDPAcK6Ns\\\"
        rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OUmDPAcK6Ns</a><p>I
        host this tool on my company\u2019s website, free for personal use. I\u2019d
        love to know if the HN community finds it useful (or to hear what breaks)!\",\"time\":1761666591,\"title\":\"Show
