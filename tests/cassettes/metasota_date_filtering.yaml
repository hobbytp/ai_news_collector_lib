        networks\\\\nNeural networks are computer models that attempt to imitate the
        parallel processing that occurs in the human brain.\\\\nThey are typically
        viewed as having some number of nodes, each with one or more inputs and one
        output.\\\\nThese nodes are arranged into multiple layers, with the outputs
        from one layer acting as the inputs to the next layer.\\\\nThe last layer
        has a single node, and its output is the output for the entire net.\\\\nThe

        that are modeled after the structure and function of the human brain.\\\\nThey
        are able to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being
        explicitly programmed to do so.\\\\nIn the field of trading, neural networks
        can be used to analyze market data and make predictions about future price
        movements.\\\\nThey can also be used to identify patterns and relationships
        in the data that humans may not be able to discern (or do so slowly and inefficiently).\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Neural

        which are mathematical functions that process input data and produce output.\\\\nThe
        input data is passed through the layers of the neural network, and each neuron
        performs a computation on the data and passes the result to the next layer.\\\\nThe
