        Robin, Louis, and Thomas. Pipelex is a DSL and a Python runtime for repeatable
        AI workflows. Think Dockerfile&#x2F;SQL for multi-step LLM pipelines: you
        declare steps and interfaces; any model&#x2F;provider can fill them.<p>Why
        this instead of yet another workflow builder?<p>- Declarative, not glue code:
        you state what to do; the runtime figures out how.\\n- Agent-first: each step
        carries natural-language context (purpose, inputs&#x2F;outputs with meaning)
        so LLMs can follow, audit, and optimize. Our MCP server enables agents to
        run pipelines but also to build new pipelines on demand.\\n- Open standard
        under MIT: language spec, runtime, API server, editor extensions, MCP server,
        n8n node.\\n- Composable: pipes can call other pipes, created by you or shared
        in the community.<p>Why a domain-specific language?<p>- We need context, meaning
        and nuances preserved in a structured syntax that both humans and LLMs can
        understand\\n- We need determinism, control, and reproducibility that pure
        prompts can&#x27;t deliver\\n- Bonus: editors, diffs, semantic coloring, easy
        sharing, search &amp; replace, version control, linters\u2026<p>How we got
        there:<p>Initially, we just wanted to solve every use-case with LLMs but kept
        rebuilding the same agentic patterns across different projects. So we challenged
        ourselves to keep the code generic and separate from use-case specifics, which
        meant modeling workflows from the relevant knowledge and know-how.<p>Unlike
        existing code&#x2F;no-code frameworks for AI workflows, our abstraction layer
        doesn&#x27;t wrap APIs, it transcribes business logic into a structured, unambiguous
        script executable by software and AI. Hence the &quot;declarative&quot; aspect:
        the script says what should be done, not how to do it. It&#x27;s like a Dockerfile
        or SQL for AI workflows.<p>Additionally, we wanted the language to be LLM-friendly.
        Classic programming languages hide logic and context in variable names, functions,
        and comments: all invisible to the interpreter. In Pipelex, these elements
        are explicitly stated in natural language, giving AI full visibility: it&#x27;s
        all logic and context, with minimal syntax.<p>Then, we didn&#x27;t want to
        write Pipelex scripts ourselves so we dogfooded: we built a Pipelex workflow
        that writes Pipelex workflows. It&#x27;s in the MCP and CLI: &quot;pipelex
        build pipe &#x27;\u2026&#x27;&quot; runs a multi-step, structured generation
        flow that produces a validated workflow ready to execute with &quot;pipelex
        run&quot;. Then you can iterate on it yourself or with any coding agent.<p>What\u2019s
        included: Python library, FastAPI and Docker, MCP server, n8n node, VS Code
        extension.<p>What we\u2019d like from you<p>1. Build a workflow: did the language
        work for you or against you?\\n2. Agent&#x2F;MCP workflows and n8n node usability.\\n3.
        Suggest new kinds of pipes and other AI models we could integrate\\n4. Looking
        for OSS contributors to the core library but also to share pipes with the
        community<p>Known limitations<p>- Connectors: Pipelex doesn\u2019t integrate
        with \u201Cyour apps\u201D, we focus on the cognitive steps, and you can integrate
        through code&#x2F;API or using MCP or n8n\\n- Visualization: we need to generate
        flow-charts\\n- The pipe builder is still buggy\\n- Run it yourself: we don\u2019t
        yet provide a hosted Pipelex API, it\u2019s in the works\\n- Cost-tracking:
        we only track LLM costs, not image generation or OCR costs yet\\n- Caching
        and reasoning options: not supported yet<p>Links<p>- GitHub: <a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Pipelex&#x2F;pipelex\\\"

        Hacker News! I\u2019m a Bayesian statistician that has been working on applying
        hierarchical mixture models (originally developed for genomics) to structure
        text data, and in the process, used these models to build (what started as
        a personal) tool for conducting literature reviews and deep research.<p>My
        literature review process starts with a broad search to find a few key papers&#x2F;groups,
        and from there expands along their citation networks. I needed to conduct
        a few rounds of literature reviews during the course of my research and decided
        to build a tool to facilitate this process. The tool started as an experimental
        wrapper over low-level statistical software in C, quickly became a testing&#x2F;iteration
        ground for our api, and is now my personal go-to for lit reviews.<p>The tool
        organizes corpuses of text content, visualizes the high level themes, and
        enables me to pull up relevant excerpts. Unlike LLMs, this model transparently
        organizes the data and can train from scratch quickly on small datasets to
        learn custom hierarchical taxonomies. My favorite part of the tool is the
        citation network integration: any research paper it pulls up has a button
        \u201CCitation Network Deep Dive\u201D that pulls every paper that cites or
        is cited by the original paper, and organizes it for further exploration.<p>I
        initially built this tool for academic research, but ended up extending it
        to support Hacker News to mine technical conversation, the top 200 Google
        results, and earnings transcripts. We have a gallery of ready to explore results
        on the homepage. If you are kicking off a custom deep dive, it takes about
        1-5 minutes for academic search, 3-7 minutes for Hacker News, and 5-10 minutes
        for Google.\\nTo demonstrate the process, I put together a video walkthrough
        of a short literature review I conducted on AI hallucinations: <a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OUmDPAcK6Ns\\\"
        rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OUmDPAcK6Ns</a><p>I
        host this tool on my company\u2019s website, free for personal use. I\u2019d
        love to know if the HN community finds it useful (or to hear what breaks)!\",\"time\":1761666591,\"title\":\"Show
